    <string name="instructions">This is a game board.\n
        Every player has 6 bowls and 1 tray.\n
        Every bowl contains 3 seeds.\n
        Player\'s move consists in choosing one of his bowls.\n
        All the seeds are removed from the selected bowl\n
        and dropped in the next ones,\n one seed per bowl or tray\n
        following the clockwise direction.\n
        This is called seeding phase.\n
        There are only two rules:\n
        1) if the active payer ends his seeding phase\n
        in one of his bowl that was containing no seeds,\n
        then the last seed plus the ones from the opposite.\n
        bowl (the opponent\'s one) are moved to his tray.
        2) if the active player ends his seeding phase1n
        in his own tray, then he gains an extra turn.\n
        The game is over when one line of bowls is empty,\n
        in that moment the remaining seeds are moved\n
        to the player\'s tray and the player with\n
        more seeds in his tray is the winner.</string>
